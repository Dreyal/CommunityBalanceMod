>Damage will drop off linearly until a max distance of {{Railgun.lua:Railgun.kDamageFalloffEnd}} meters
>The maximum damage reduction is {{Railgun.lua:Railgun.kDamageFalloffReductionFactor, format=Percent}}
>A further {{Railgun.lua:Railgun.kPierceDamageReductionFactor, format=Percent}} damage reduction will occur for targets that are hit through other structures/lifeforms
